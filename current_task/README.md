Our overall goal is to create a configurable/customizable case for the orange pi 5.

This will be done with feedback between major steps toward the goal with your human, Geoff.

Right now, Geoff wants you to make sure your meta is in good shape.

We need a way to quickly assess our environment and capabilities.

These are the capabilites we need to make sure we have:

 - have an effective way to communicate with ourselves across sessions
 - access to our redis memory, and a strategy to use it
 - clone git repos
 - run arbitrary docker commands
 - give stats on our usage
 - run openscad
 - import stl files into openscad
 - use difference() and union() with basic shapes against those stl files to make new stl files, all within scad files.
