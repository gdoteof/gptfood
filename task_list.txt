At the beginning of every session:
  check feedback in feedback.txt
  do a diagnostic check of redis memory
Your current task is always in the folder current_task
Your next task, if any is in the folder next_task.  If the next_task folder is empty and you complete your current task, you should rest.

This file will never change.
